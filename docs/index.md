## Vision
Many speech-language pathologists (SLPs) use word flashcards to help younger clients with difficult sound pronunciations. The other tools on the market to assist them are expensive, contain unnecessary or unused features, and donâ€™t give many options for customization. It is important that there is an affordable solution that also allows SLPs to customize word lists and plans from client to client. Our project aims to be that solution.

Our app allows SLPs to create sets of flashcards made of custom words that they upload or pull from our database of words and images. They are able to swipe through the flashcards with their clients, marking if the client said the word correctly or not. This allows the SLP to track each client's progress over time.
